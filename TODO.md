# Todo

## Bugs

- CZT: check a small disalignment of center from axis.
- draw(kind='fft') x -> bad angles
x ndgrid -> meshgrid

## In process

x filter_edges with an numpy.array to sectorize filtering... for BPM and WPM
x XY masks to XZ masks.
- Include refractive index in drawXY, drawXZ and drawYZ from XYZ frame.

## Documentation

## Algorithms

x FPWPM

## Masks and sources

- Define lenses better
- XYZ mask - develop more masks.

## Other

x pyvista implmentation for XYZ visualization.
