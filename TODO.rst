Things to do, wishes
================================================

Bugs
----------------------
- bugs in bitbucket
- CZT: check a small disalignment of center from axis.
- draw(kind='fft') x -> bad angles

In process
----------------------
- Implementation of vector parameters in XYZ. (irradiance, energy_density, etc)
- Reordering drawing functions
- new parameters in get for vector_XZ and vector_XYZ, as well as XY

Documentation
----------------------
- Tutorial and examples vector_XZ and vector_XYZ

Algorithms
----------------------
- Pass um = 1. to um = 1e-6 at __init__: (seems to work, but have to fix drawings)
- Interactive drawings for XYZ and vector_XYZ (similar to those of XY and XZ).
- Implement Backpropagation for FP_WPM XZ, vector XZ and vector_XYZ.

Masks and sources
----------------------
- Vector_masks for XYZ.
- Lenses for XZ and XYZ, including aberrations
- Edges for XY and vector XY from XYZ
