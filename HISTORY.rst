0.3.1
--------------------------------
Beta state

  - Package has been moved to github: https://github.com/optbrea/diffractio/


* Improvements:

  - new fresnel_equations_kx, fresnel_equations, transmitances_reflectances_kx, transmitances_reflectances functions.
  
  - Pyvista has been implemented for 3D visualization. 

  - 'check_none' function (utils_common) has been implemented to check if a variable is None.

  - 'add function' (utils_common, and scalar_fields) has been modified to take into consideration different procedures for adding sources or masks.

  - 'oversampling function' has been implemented to increase the resolution of the masks (utils_common, and Scalar X, XY, XYZ, XZ, Z). This is also performed with the cut_resample function. However, this function oversamples with integer factors.

  - FP_WPM for vector XZ and XYZ fields has been implemented.

  - Implementation of scalar (intensity, phase, amplitude) and vector (irradiance, energy_density, etc) parameters in get function.



* Fix bugs:

  - new definition of X mask: fresnel_lens
  
  - ndgrid -> meshgrid (this produced a lot of minor bugs)
  

* Refactoring:

  - refraction_index -> refractive_index ... in all words.

  - XZ masks: sphere -> cylinder.
              semi-sphere -> semi-cylinder.


* New features:

  - XY masks: edge_rough, slit_rough, double_slit_rough, squares_nxm

  - XY masks: .dxf method for loading masks from .dxf files.

  - XZ masks: .dxf method for loading masks from .dxf files.
  
  - XYZ masks: .stl method for loading 3D masks from .stl files.

  - XZ masks: New refractive_index_from_scalar_mask_XY method.

  - has_edges parameters in WPM and BPM methods can be an array masking in desired z positions.

  - vector XZ fields:   FPWPM algorithm has been implemented for vector propagation.

  - vector XYZ fields:   FPWPM algorithm has been implemented for vector propagation.

  - vector XY mask: SLM (spatial light modulator) to simulate the behaviour of a SLM.

0.2.3 (2023-11-21)
--------------------------------
Beta state

* Improvement:

  - XYZ drawings is removed temporally.

  - utils_slicer.py is deprecated.


* Fix bugs:

  - Bug in XYZ video

  - Blazed grating wrong defined. 
  
  - bug in Scalar_field_XY.kernelRSinverse


* New features:

  - XY masks: new polygon, regular_polygon, star, and superformula functions. 

  - XY masks: new circular_sector function.

  - XY masks: new lens_cyliindrical function.

  - X, XY, XYZ fields: new conjugate function.

  - WPM function without storing all the data.

  - X fields: inverse_amplitude, inverse_phase, pupil


0.1.1 (2022-10-16)
--------------------------------
Beta state

* Vector fields are not longer paraxial.

  - The propagation algorithms implemented (VRS, VFFT and VCZT) provide :E_z: field. This allows to analyze longitudinal fields.The modules and classes elliminate changes their name. For example vector_paraxial_fields_X is now vector_fields_X.


* New propagation algorithm Chirped Z-Transform (CZT) is avaliable for X and XY fields.

  - This algorithms produce similar results to RS and VRS fields, but there are significant advantages:

  - The output field is not necessarily the same as the input field. This is important, for example, when analyzing the focus of a lens, since the computing time is dedicated to areas with light.

  - The output field does not necessarily have the same dimensionality of the input field. For example, when the mask is XY, we can have the data only at (x=0, y=0, z) axis.

  - Acceleration in computing and reduction of memory usage.


* New modules for visualization and data analysis are provided.

  - Scalar_field_Z can be used, for example, to analysis of intensity light at axis.

  - Vector_fields_Z, Vector_fields_XZ, and Vector_fields_XYZ have been developed, as VCZT algorithm can provide these data.

* Plane Wave Descomposition algorithm (PWD) is deprecated.

* Some importante bugs have been solved. For example the definition of the spherical coordinates in some sources (which not used standard physics criterion).

* Mask parameters is removed in some XY masks, as lenses, FPZ, etc. The new way to do this is the .pupil() function.

* Smooth_refractive index can be used also for Wave Propagation Method algorithm (WPM).

  - mask_circle -> pupil
  - 

* New vector_fields_XY:

  - vector_paraxial_fields -> vector_fields
